# tiger-programming-language README

The tiger Programming Language is a coding language derived from HTML and converter from .tgr to .html through a Javascript file compiling tiger Code to HTML Browser code. The benefit of using the tiger Language as opposed to HTML is a simpler syntax, customizable syntax, and the overall design change. The tiger Language is intended to be converted to HTML through the client's browser and displayed in the 'index.html' file in the tiger Framework (https://github.com/aaron-meche/tiger-language)

## Features

- Customizable Keywords
- Add your own features
- Compiler is written in Javascript, so it is very easy to read and modify
- Lightweight compiler allows for fast conversions
- All of the pages are displayed within the same file (index.html), only distinguished by the url query: "p=[page]"
- Content outside of the modified HTML will remain static on the page and not have to be reloaded every page change, leading to shorter load times
- The tiger Language works offline, as long as the client can connect to the Javascript compiler

> Tip: Within the COMPILE.JS file you can customize virtually anything about the language along with its syntax
