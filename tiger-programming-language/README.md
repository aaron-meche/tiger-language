# baileo-programming-language README

The Baileo Programming Language is a coding language derived from HTML and converter from .by to .html through a Javascript file compiling Baileo Code to HTML Browser code. The benefit of using the Baileo Language as opposed to HTML is a simpler syntax, customizable syntax, and the overall design change. The Baileo Language is intended to be converted to HTML through the client's browser and displayed in the 'index.html' file in the Baileo Framework (https://github.com/aaron-meche/baileo-language)

## Features

- Customizable Keywords
- Add your own features
- Compiler is written in Javascript, so it is very easy to read and modify
- Lightweight compiler allows for fast conversions
- All of the pages are displayed within the same file (index.html), only distinguished by the url query: "p=[page]"
- Content outside of the modified HTML will remain static on the page and not have to be reloaded every page change, leading to shorter load times
- The Baileo Language works offline, as long as the client can connect to the Javascript compiler

> Tip: Within the COMPILE.JS file you can customize virtually anything about the language along with its syntax
